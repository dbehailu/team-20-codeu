      <p>We wanted to make an easy way for people to both find and post about found items, and thought that a location-based lost and found page would be quite useful. <br><br> Our user group is primarily college students, since people often lose water bottles, ID cards, etc. <br><br> Our webpage isn't super developed yet, and right now, we are only able to post messages via the user page (after you log in) and search via the navigation bar. We hope to enable image uploading and map pinning soon to ensure a seamless user experience. <br><br>For posting, first log into your Gmail account, then on your user page, copy paste a URL to the image and write a description.<br><br> The search function also works, so search any terms and the page will refresh with any posts that match. If you want to see all the posts again after searching something, you can do an empty search.</p>
